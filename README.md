# Word Document for Installation Instructions
This is a link to a word document where we talk through the installation instructions. I'm still working on adding more detail, but anyone with an Oxford email address should be able to edit this word document: [installation_instructions] (https://unioxfordnexus-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ndos1275_ox_ac_uk/ESv8hiNZAt1JoXcwiCYKiAMB4iFqtY3adaS849ZEQHXiUg?e=dLbWfa)

# To Do
* ~~Virtual Machines for Mac and Windows~~
* ~~Test setup scripts~~
* ~~Test Python installation~~
* ~~Test whether e.g. scikit-learn works~~
* ~~Write *detailed* instructions for installation:~~  
    * ~~Should cover Windows and Mac  ~~
    * ~~Suggest using Anaconda, but Miniconda + scripts is also an option~~  
* Write Jupyter notebooks with all the tasks 
    * Basic pandas/python/EDA
    * Scikit-learn for the HPV/head cancer
    * Scikit-learn, lifelines, SHAP for the other case
* Datasets?
    * ~Dan to acquire these?~
    * A dataset to demonstrate treatment response 
* Find a better solution for dataset storage than keeping in the Git repo!
