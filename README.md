# Word Document for Installation Instructions
This is a link to a word document where we talk through the installation instructions. I'm still working on adding more detail, but anyone with an Oxford email address should be able to edit this word document: [installation_instructions] (https://unioxfordnexus-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ndos1275_ox_ac_uk/ESv8hiNZAt1JoXcwiCYKiAMB4iFqtY3adaS849ZEQHXiUg?e=dLbWfa)

# Questions 
* Lacking treatment information for the prostate cancer patients: should we just say they were all prostatectomies?
  
* How confident are we in their python expertise...?

# Short Course
* Notebooks made, relatively happy with them
* Need reviewing by Dan
* Do we need a more detailed "Python basics" notebook?

# Long Course
* Currently have just copied the short course notebooks into the long course
* Worth having a discussion about what the content for the long course actually needs to be?
* How should it differ from the short course?
